# iVQE
Incremental Decomposition Algorithm.
To investigated highly correlated molecular electronic structures, iVQE enables the 
incremental decomposition with post-Hartree-Fock methods. In addtion to classical 
computational chemistry methods a variational quantumeigensolver (VQE) has been 
introduced.
